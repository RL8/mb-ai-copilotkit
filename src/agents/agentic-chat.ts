I can help you think through course creation systematically:

**ðŸ’¡ My Analysis:**
- You're interested in automated course generation
- This involves content planning, structure design, and delivery methods
- This could benefit from multiple AI agents working together

**ðŸ§  Let me break this down:**

1. **Course Planning**: What subject/topic are you targeting?
2. **Content Structure**: Modules, lessons, assessments, practical exercises
3. **Delivery Method**: Video, text, interactive, hybrid approach
4. **Target Audience**: Skill level, learning preferences, time constraints

**ðŸ”„ Agent Recommendation:**
For course generation, you might benefit from switching to our **Generative UI agent** (coming in Phase 2) which can create interactive course interfaces and visual content.

**Next Steps:** What specific aspect of course generation interests you most? The content creation, platform design, or learning methodology?`;

${context.conversationHistory ? `Building on our previous discussion about ${this.extractTopics(context.conversationHistory)}.` : 'Starting fresh - I\'ll remember everything we discuss.'}

**ðŸ’­ My Reasoning:**
You're asking about starting something, which suggests:
- You have a project or goal in mind
- You might need help with planning or next steps
- You're looking for guidance on how to begin

**ðŸŽ¯ How I can help you start:**

1. **Goal Clarification**: What exactly do you want to start?
2. **Resource Assessment**: What do you have available?
3. **Step-by-Step Planning**: Break it into manageable phases
4. **Timeline & Milestones**: When do you want to achieve what?

**Questions to move forward:**
- What project or goal are you thinking about starting?
- What's your timeline?
- What resources or constraints should I know about?

I'll remember all our planning details for future conversations!`;

**ðŸ§  My Analysis:**
You're interested in Xero's API, which tells me:
- You're likely working on business/accounting automation
- You need to integrate financial data with applications
- This is a technical implementation project

**ðŸ’¡ Xero API Capabilities:**
- **Accounting Data**: Invoices, contacts, payments, bank transactions
- **Real-time Sync**: Live financial data integration  
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication flow
- **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications of data changes

**ðŸŽ¯ Planning Your Xero Integration:**

1. **Use Case Definition**: What business process are you automating?
2. **Data Requirements**: Which Xero endpoints do you need?
3. **Authentication Setup**: OAuth app registration with Xero
4. **Development Environment**: Testing vs production considerations

**ðŸ”„ Agent Recommendations:**
- **Tool-based UI Agent** (Phase 6) will excel at API integration interfaces
- **Human in Loop Agent** (Phase 3) could help with approval workflows for financial data

**Next Steps:**
- What specific business problem are you solving with Xero?
- Are you building a custom app or integrating with existing software?
- What's your technical background with APIs?

I'll track all the technical details we discuss!`;

- **Context Memory**: I remember our entire conversation history
- **Multi-turn Planning**: I help you achieve complex goals over time
- **Agent Coordination**: I can suggest when other AI agents would be better

**ðŸ’­ I notice this is ${context.conversationHistory ? 'a continuation of our chat' : 'our first interaction'}.**

**ðŸŽ¯ How I can help:**
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Remember important details across our conversations
- Suggest switching to specialized agents when appropriate
- Plan multi-step projects with you

What would you like to work on together? I'm particularly good with planning, problem-solving, and coordinating complex tasks!`;
